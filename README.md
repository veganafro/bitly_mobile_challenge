# Summary
The objective of this challenge was to create a simple mobile app that communicated with three Bitly API endpoints. The results of the exercise are in the repo above.

# Usage
The app must be launched in the Xcode simulator. For security purposes, some files are not available on this repo. Assuming you have all files, simply select a device and run the app.
- Tapping `save link` allows you to save a long URL as a Bitlink. You must supply both a long URL and a title.
- Tapping `link history` will present a table view of your saved Bitlinks with their titles below.
- Tapping `link clicks` will present an alert showing the aggregate number of clikcs for all your Bitlinks.
